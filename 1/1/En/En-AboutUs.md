UniCFD laboratory
=================

The UniCFD Web-laboratory was created on the base of 
ISP RAS institute <www.ispras.ru> in 2011 as the continuation
of the UniHUB technological platform and is aimed at 
supporting open community of researchers, whose 
scientific interests refer to methods of solving 
continuum mechanic problems using free application 
packages. The laboratory welcomes new participants.

Main areas of our activity within the laboratory are: 

+ development of software for solving problems of mechanics of continuous media;
+ numerical simulations including pre- and postprocessing of industrial problems;
+ mesh generation;
+ visualization;
+ fundamental researches;
+ education, consulting.

Examples of open-source software developed by our group can be found 
at <https://github.com/unicfdlab>. We are updating repositories with
latest changes permanently.

Videos with results of our simulations, training materials and seminars
can be found in the youtube channel for UNICFD LAB <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT0E3IuqMPudgP7Qpe13Eig>

In the December of each year we are organizing conference dedicated to
open source software for solving coninuous media problems
<http://www.isprasopen.ru/en/conf/cfd.html>

We are open for both commercial and non-profit cooperation.
