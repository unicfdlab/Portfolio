The 9th seminar of the Web-laboratory of Continuum Mechanics
=================
The nineth seminar of the Web-laboratory of Continuum Mechanics was held 21 November 2019 in the Institute for System Programming of the RAS.

The topic of the seminar:
Simulation of waves attractors in stratified and rotating fluids with regularized equations of hydrodynamics.

Abstract:
Report represents results of numerical simulations of internal waves and inertial waves attractors. Simulations was provided by three different ways: Navie-Stokes implementation based on OpenFOAM, quasihydrodynamic implementation based on OpenFOAM and Navie-Stokes based on high order method implementation on Nek5000. Considered a brief historical background which preceded increased interests by science community to internal waves. Explained some important properties of internal and inertial waves — angle of propagation, reflection future and focusing of wave rays. Set of solved problems include plane attractor of internal waves, biharmonic attractor of internal waves, attractor in three-dimensional trapeze reservoir, attractor with local source of internal waves. Second part of the report reserved for attractors creations in rotating fluids with different ways of inertial wave generation — libration, precession, axisymmetric oscillation.
