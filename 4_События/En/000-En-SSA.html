<h1 id="capabilities-of-opensource-packages-salomeopenfoamparaview-for-solving-mcm-problems">Capabilities of opensource packages (Salome/OpenFOAM/Paraview) for solving MCM problems</h1>
<p>Lectures and workshops on certain subjects of implementing supercomputing technologies and developing parallel algorithms and software for high-performance computing systems will be taking place from June 23rd till July 1st in Moscow State University under the Summer Supercomputing Academy. The main focus of the Academy education program is on problems of building super-scalable applications for solving current computing-complicated problems.</p>
<p>A brief overview of the open packages for solving MCC (continuum mechanics). Capabilities of web-lab UniHUB and supercomputer “Lomonosov”. Features of environment settings and scheduler’s packaging Salome / OpenFOAM / Paraview. Access to the working console. Stories create packages Salome / OpenFOAM / Paraview. Key capabilities of OpenFOAM for solving the MLS. The directory structure. Comparison of two different directions (basic and extended versions) in the development of the package OpenFOAM. Describes a method of control volume, which is the basis for the solution of partial differential equations. Academic and practical problems solved using OpenFOAM. Overview of standard solvers in OpenFOAM. Official page of track</p>
