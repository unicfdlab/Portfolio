<p>Members of the UniCFD laboratory took part in the XV Russian School-Conference of Young Scientists “Problems of Mechanics: Theory, Experiment and New Technologies” (http://conf.ict.nsc.ru/pm2020/ru), dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Academician N. N. Yanenko.</p>
<p>The conference was held in a mixed form in Novosibirsk and in the Sheregesh village (Kemerovo region).</p>
<p>We made the following presentations: * Romanova D. I. “Development of the avalancheFoam solver for modeling a snow avalanche as a turbulent flow of a non-Newtonian medium on a slope” * Sautkina S. M., Korchagova V. N., Marchevsky I. K. “Using the discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations” * Korchagova V. N., Sautkina S. M. “Using open-source software for solving Euler equations by the discontinuous Galerkin method” * Kraposhin M. V. “QGDSOLVER - an open framework for modeling liquid and gas flows based on regularized equations”</p>
<p>Also, our girls also won a competition for creating paper airplanes and a skiing competition among the participants of the conference. _________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
