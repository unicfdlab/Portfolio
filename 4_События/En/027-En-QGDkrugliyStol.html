<h1 id="round-table-quasi-gas-dynamic-equations---past-present-and-future">Round table: Quasi-gas-dynamic equations - past, present and future</h1>
<p>The laboratory members took part in the round table “Quasi–gas-dynamic equations - Past, Present and Future”, held at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences on April 16.</p>
<p>Our members made following presentations: * M. V. Kraposhin - QGDsolver-open implementation of QGD/QGiD algorithms. * A. S. Epikhin - Features of the application of regularized equations for numerical modeling of jet flows in the OpenFOAM environment. * A.V. Ivanov - OpenFOAM solver based on the QGDSolver library for modeling flows in the shallow water approximation. * D. A. Ryazanov - QHDFoam solver for modeling the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid and an example of the formation of a gravitational wave attractor.</p>
<p>In discussion, the importance of cooperation with the ISP RAS and the introduction of equations in open-source software accessible to a mass audience was highlight.</p>
<p>The laboratory staff joins the congratulations on the anniversary of the Chief researcher of the IPM RAS, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor Tatyana Elizarova (http://elizarova.imamod.ru/), who made a great contribution to the derivation and development of quasi-gas-dynamic equations. ______________________________________________</p>
