Round table: Quasi-gas-dynamic equations - past, present and future
=================
The laboratory members took part in the round table "Quasi–gas-dynamic equations - Past, Present and Future", held at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences on April 16.

Our members made following presentations:
* M. V. Kraposhin - QGDsolver-open implementation of QGD/QGiD algorithms.
* A. S. Epikhin - Features of the application of regularized equations for numerical modeling of jet flows in the OpenFOAM environment.
* A.V. Ivanov - OpenFOAM solver based on the QGDSolver library for modeling flows in the shallow water approximation.
* D. A. Ryazanov - QHDFoam solver for modeling the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid and an example of the formation of a gravitational wave attractor.

In discussion, the importance of cooperation with the ISP RAS and the introduction of equations in open-source software accessible to a mass audience was highlight.

The laboratory staff joins the congratulations on the anniversary of the Chief researcher of the IPM RAS, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor Tatyana Elizarova (http://elizarova.imamod.ru/), who made a great contribution to the derivation and development of quasi-gas-dynamic equations.
