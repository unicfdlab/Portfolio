<p>Dear colleagues!</p>
<p>The fourth seminar of the Web-laboratory of Mechanics of a continuous medium was held on May 22nd, in the Institute for System Programming of the RAS, room 111 at 17:00.</p>
<p>The theme of the seminar: Implementation of OpenFOAM-based solver for computational simulation of flows through quasihydrodynamic equations.</p>
<p>Presenter: Ryazanov Daniil Alexandrovich (Ivannikov ISP of the RAS, M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University).</p>
<p>Abstract: Issues of implementing OpenFOAM-based solver for computational simulation of flows through regualized hydrodynamics equations (quasihydrodynamic or QHD equations). Equations system and approximating expressions are formulated for: a) medium motion with subsonic speed and random equation of condition, b) incompressible medium motion and c) incompressible medium motion with consideration of buoyancy in Boussinesq approximation. Boundary conditions and their approximation by control volume method are formulated.</p>
<p>The following tasks are studied for the developed QHDFoam-solver: 1) simulation of incompressible medium flow in cavity with floating head under Re=100, 400 and 1000; 2) simulation of incompressible medium flow in channel with backward-facing step under Re= 100, 200 and 400 and 3) simulation of buoyancy flow in heated cavity under Gr=10000. Obtained calculation results are compared with known benchmark data.</p>
<p>In the future it is planned to use the solver for solving the following current typical aerodynamics and oceanology issues: a) unsteady flow of objects with flow breakdown under high Re numbers (sphere, Ahmed body); b) simulation of heated plane-parallel flow (Benard cells); c) simulation of internal wavesâ€™ attractors.</p>
