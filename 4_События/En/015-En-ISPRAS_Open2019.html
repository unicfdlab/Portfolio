<h1 id="ivannikov-isp-ras-open-conference-2019">Ivannikov ISP RAS Open Conference 2019</h1>
<p>Section &quot;Open source software for continuum mechanics&quot; was held 5-6 December, 2019 during the &quot;Ivannikov ISP RAS Open Conference&quot;, in the building of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>The section is devoted to the use of open source software in solving continuum mechanics problems (OpenFOAM, Salome, ParaView, DAKOTA etc.) and comparison of developed software with commercial programs. The topics include: - Turbulent flows modeling. - Solving adjoined thermal exchange problems. - Applied hydrodynamics, gas dynamics and aerodynamics problems. - Development of personal problem solvers and libraries. - Scientific visualization and processing of numerical results. - Education based on open packages issues.</p>
