2nd seminar of ISP RAS web-laboratory for Mechanics of a continuous medium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Place: ISP RAS, 17:00, room 110

"Experimental study of the hydrodynamics of a droplet splash"

Presenter:

A.Yu. Ilinykh

The results of the development of a technique for high-resolution recording of the flow structure
during the immersion of a drop in a liquid and the analysis of experiments with miscible and immiscible
media are presented. The main attention is paid to the visualization of the position of the streamers 
of the primary contact of the droplet; investigation of the angular distribution of the scattered sprays;
the study of distribution patterns of the falling drop matter over the surface of the crown and the 
cavity in the target-liquid in the case of miscible and immiscible liquids, and also the determination 
of short capillary waves parameters at various stages of the process.

1st seminar of ISP RAS web-laboratory for Mechanics of a continuous medium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Place: ISP RAS, 17:00, room 110

"Application of discontinuous Galerkin method for solving gas dynamics equations: ideas, approaches, challenges"

Presenters:

1. Lukin V.V. (Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics RAS)
2. Marchevsky I. K. (Bauman Moscow State University)

Approaches for construction of numerical solution of inviscid perfect gas dynamics equations using discontinuous
Galerking method are considered. Questions of selection of basis functions, non-monotonicity indicators and limiters 
are studied for the case of one dimensional flow. Different WENO limiters with generalization are considered for
moments of order greater than zero. Results of simulation for well-known cases are presented. Ways of enhancement
for three-dimensional case are discussed.
