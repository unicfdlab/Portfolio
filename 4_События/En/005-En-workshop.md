=================
Under the conference ISP RAS will organize workshops on following topics:
1. Bodies and environment flow interaction processes simulation: aeroelasticity, hydroelasticity, FSI.

Instructor: d.t.s., assistant professor, Scheglov G.A.

Date: November, 30, 2017

Time: 10:00-17:30

Venue: ISP RAS, Moscow, A. Solzhenitsyna street, Room 110 (road map).

This workshop includes theoretical part (length 1.5 hours) and practical studies (length 4.5 hours).

The lecture is dedicated to problems of construction elements and incompressible flow interaction simulation. It tells about general aeroelasticity and hydroelasticity problems statement, as well as setting of fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems, which still do not have an adequate Russian name. Different approaches to computational simulation of FSI problems with the use of mesh-based and meshless methods of computational hydrodynamics.

The lecture is concluded with description of model problems for self-study with the use of OpenFOAM package Ext version tools and meshless method of vortex elements и бессеточным методом вихревых элементов:

    unelastic outline vibrations in two-dimensional parallel flow;
    elastic outline vibrations in two-dimensional parallel flow.

2. Theory and practice of viscous compressive flows simulation by quasigasdynamic equations tools.

Instructor: d.p.-m.s., prof., Elizarova T.G.

Date: 30, 2017

Time: 10:00-17:30

Venue: ISP RAS, Moscow, A. Solzhenitsyna street, Room 111 (road map).

This workshop includes theoretical part (length 1.5 hours) and practical studies (length 4.5 hours).

The lecture is dedicated to problems of simulating viscous gas flows in wide Mach number range (0.1 — 50) in quasigasdynamic (QGD) approximation. It tells about general principles of QCD equations system generation, it general layout, discusses limits to applicability, physical interpretation and connection with other continuum models – Navier-Stokes equation and Euler equation. Also it examines advantages of the QGD-approach compared with more common N-S equations. Examples of QGD-equations approximation for simplest cases and results of some typical disintegration of discontinuities problems calculations are provided.

The lecture is concluded with description of model problems for self-study with the use of OpenFOAM package:

    Flow over a backward-facing step;
    The Hartmann whistle;
    Calculation of flow in the vicinity of cylinder;
    Discharge of underexpanded supersonic stream from nozzle.
