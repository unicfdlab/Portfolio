Training track "Incompressible Fluid Simulation Using Regularized Hydrodynamics Equations in OpenFOAM® V1912"
=================

Our team successfully held a mini-track "Incompressible Fluid Simulation Using Regularized Hydrodynamics Equations in OpenFOAM® V1912" at the conference of Young Scientists in Mechanics YSM-2020 on September 7 and 8 in Sochi, MSU "Burevestnik" resort.

The purpose of this training track is to tell about the capabilities of the new OpenFOAM solvers developed by our team. We considered two software implementations of QHD numerical algorithms - QHDFoam and particlesQHDFoam solvers [https://unicfd.ru/software/framework-qgdsolver/]. Also, we discussed the features of working with them and some test examples.
