Learning how to use free surface flows in OpenFOAM® 4.1
-------------------------------------------------------

**Instructor:** Victoria Korchagova, ISP RAS (Russia)

**Training type:** Intermediate

**Session type:** Lecture with examples

**Software stack:** OpenFOAM 4.1, OpenFOAM 3.0.x

**Developers of this session:**

* V. Korchagova, Russia

**Development team website:** <http://unicfd.ru>

**Presentation language:** English

**Description:**

Due to several changes made in OpenFOAM 2.3 
and newer versions, this session aims to teach you how to 
setup your cases accordingly to run with **interFoam**.

This will be a hybrid type of session: the training track will 
be presented as a lecture with examples, which consists of two parts. 
The first stage is the discussion on internal structure of **interFoam** 
solver: governing equations and approximation techniques. The second 
stage is the training session where the updated "Spillway" tutorial (see figure
below) and Rayleigh-Taylor instability (see figure after "Spillway" tutorial)
will be presented.

The structure of the training course is the following.

1. Introduction: why free-surface flows are so interesting for researchers and engineers; key point of training course – boundary conditions in different versions of OpenFOAM.
2. Overview of **interFoam** internal structure.
3. Description of the example case for the training course – "Spillway".
4. Steps to run "Spillway" tutorial (see results in figures below):
    (a) **blockMesh** utility and "blockMeshDict" structure;
    (b) **snappyHexMesh** and **extrudeMesh** utilities;
    (c) boundary conditions setup (volume fraction/velocity/pressure);
    (d) "fvSchemes" and "fvSolution" setup;
    (e) running **interFoam**; results comparision from different versions of OpenFOAM.
5. Running Rayleigh-Taylor instability case (see results in figures below).
6. Conclusions and discussion.

After running simulation, we will obtain evolution of hydrodynamic fields (velocity and pressure
and liquid volume fraction) for RT and Spillway cases - see animation.

The attendees will be prompted to do all the steps themselves during the session.
