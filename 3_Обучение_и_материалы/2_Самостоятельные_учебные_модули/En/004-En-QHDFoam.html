<h2 id="incompressible-flow-simulation-using-regularized-hydrodynamics-equations-in-openfoam-v1912">Incompressible flow simulation using regularized hydrodynamics equations in OpenFOAM v1912</h2>
<p>Instructors: Tatiana Stenina, Aleksandr Ivanov, ISP RAS (Russia).</p>
<p>Training type: Intermediate.</p>
<p>Session type: Lecture with examples.</p>
<p>Software stack: OpenFOAM v1912.</p>
<p>Developers of this session: T. Stenina, A. Ivanov, M. Kraposhin, I. Sibgatullin.</p>
<p>Presentation language: English.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>One of the methods for the numerical simulation of viscous incompressible fluid flows is the quasi-hydrodynamic (QHD) approach. It is based on the regularized hydrodynamic equations, which are a generalization of the Navier-Stokes equations. This approach has a wide range of practical applications, as well as good research potential. An OpenFOAM framework based on the quasi-gas dynamic (QGD) / QHD methods were developed for convenient work with regularized equations.</p>
<p>The training track is split into two modules, which correspond to two solvers that implement QHD numerical algorithms – the QHDFoam and particlesQHDFoam solvers. The QHDFoam is based on quasi-hydrodynamic equations and is designed to simulate incompressible flows with buoyancy and viscosity is taken into account. The solvers are suitable for problems with complex curved geometry.</p>
<p>The particlesQHDFoam solver is designed to simulate a three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow of an incompressible fluid coupled with particle simulations. The solution of the hydrodynamics equations system is carried out using the QHD approach with an additional OpenFOAM library to particle movement calculation.</p>
<p>The first part of each module is an introduction to the theory of the regularized hydrodynamic equations and the mathematical model. In the second part of the module, the instructor, together with the students, performs test problems and analyzes the obtained results. Cavity flow and particle motions in a backward-facing step are considered as a tutorial (see Fig. below).</p>
