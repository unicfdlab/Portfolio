Shatsky Maxim
==============================================================================================================================================================

Maxim graduated from the bachelor of physics faculty of Moscow State University (MSU) in 2018. Currently, he is a master student of the "Atomic nucleus physics and quantum collision theory" department of the physics faculty of MSU.

Professional interests: numerical simulation of physical processes and data analysis. The main activity is related to the development of automation tools for data analysis and integration of numerical modeling platforms.

Participation in projects:
- scientific-research work "Interference of direct and resonance-like mechanisms in the processes of one- and twoion generation in malonucleon systems at intermediate energies.‚Äù (2016);
- program development for the rocket launch gasdynamics simulation, which allows to predict the noise level in the far field near the launchpad (2019).
