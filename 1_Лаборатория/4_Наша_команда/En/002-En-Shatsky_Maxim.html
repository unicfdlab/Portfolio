<h1 id="shatsky-maxim">Shatsky Maxim</h1>
<p>Maxim graduated from the bachelor of physics faculty of Moscow State University (MSU) in 2018. Currently, he is a master student of the &quot;Atomic nucleus physics and quantum collision theory&quot; department of the physics faculty of MSU.</p>
<p>Professional interests: numerical simulation of physical processes and data analysis. The main activity is related to the development of automation tools for data analysis and integration of numerical modeling platforms.</p>
<p>Participation in projects: - scientific-research work &quot;Interference of direct and resonance-like mechanisms in the processes of one- and twoion generation in malonucleon systems at intermediate energies.‚Äù (2016); - program development for the rocket launch gasdynamics simulation, which allows to predict the noise level in the far field near the launchpad (2019).</p>
