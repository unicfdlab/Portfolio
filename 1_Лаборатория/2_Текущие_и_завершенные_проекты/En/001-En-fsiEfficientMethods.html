<p>It is planned to perform investigations using existent scientific background and experience in software development for further development and analysis of the modern methods of computational aerohydrodynamics, which are not implemented in known Russian and foreign software packages. Their software implementation as fully functional prototypes of the programs adapting to perform computations on the modern multiprocessor computers with cluster architecture is also planned. The considered methods seem to be effective and actual for the following areas.</p>

<p>Under the outlined numerical methods authors of this proposal developed and implemented new modifications of corresponding approaches, which prove high computational effectiveness for specified problems. Investigations of parallelization and algorithms adaptation for providing computations on the multiprocessor computers also were performed.</p>
