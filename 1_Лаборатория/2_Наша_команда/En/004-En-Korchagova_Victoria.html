<h1 id="korchagova-victoria">Korchagova Victoria</h1>
<p>Victoria graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU) in 2016 in “Engineer-mathematician” specialty. Currently she is a PhD student at BMSTU “Applied mathematics” department.</p>
<p>She is an author and co-author of about 15 papers and conference abstracts on topics connected with numericall simulation of procesess hydro-gas dynamics, aeroacoustics and thermal conductivity (2 papers are included in the Scopus database).</p>
<p>Professional interests: numerical methods; hydro-, gasdynamics; aeroacoustics; high-order methods; discontinuous Galerkin method.</p>
<p>Participation in projects: - dynamics investigation of small high-speed drops falling into a deep liquid layer and onto a dry solid surface within of stereolithography process modeling;<br />
- program development for the rocket launch gasdynamics simulation, which allows to predict the noise level in the far field near the launchpad; - program development for automatic calculation of aerodynamics and stress fields to study the influence of external conditions (wind direction and speed and etc.) on the structures deformation, the program is integrated into the software package.</p>
<p>Lecturer of training courses:: • 11th OpenFOAM Workshop, 2016 • Summer supercomputing Academy, MSU, 2017 • 12th OpenFOAM Workshop, 2017 • School of numerical modeling MAI-ISPRAS, 2019</p>
<p>Achievements: • graduated FN2 BMSTU department with high honours degree; • winner of the all-Russian competition of research works in the field of engineering and Humanities in the category “Fundamental and applied mathematics. Numerical modeling”, 2016 • member of Technical Comittee of opensource package OpenFOAM</p>
