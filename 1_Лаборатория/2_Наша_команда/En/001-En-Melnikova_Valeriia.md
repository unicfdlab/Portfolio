==============================================================================================================================================================

Valeriia graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU) in 2018. Currently she is a PhD student at BMSTU "Aerospace systems" department.

Works in UniCFD laboratory since 2016.

She is an author and co-author of about 14 papers and 19 conference abstracts on flow modeling and aerospace topics (6 papers are included in the Scopus database).

Professional interests: hydro-, gasdynamics; hydro-, aeroelasticity; control volume method; LBM; pfvm; vortex methods; dynamic grids; stress simulations.

Participation in projects:
- program development for the rocket launch gasdynamics simulation, which allows to predict the noise level in the far field near the launchpad;
- program development for automatic calculation of aerodynamics and stress fields to study the influence of external conditions (wind direction and speed and etc.) on the structures deformation, the program is integrated into the software package.

Achievements:
- winner of the Moscow Government Young Scientist Award for 2018 in the field of "Aviation and space technologies";
- honored of the Yuri Gagarin scholarship in the 2019-2020 academic year.
